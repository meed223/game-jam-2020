## Our Game Idea <br>
The title of our game is "Some assembly required" <br>
The idea of this game is that you are a broken robot trying to re-assmble itself in some abandoned factory / laboratory.
<br>
## How to modify our game <br>
You can modifiy most elements of our game, from using a custom map layout to using your own assets.

To make your own map, you will need a PNG file and a .cfg file (plain-text) both with the same name. 
The PNG file will be used to place walls, crates, etc. on the map - including floor tiles. The config file is used to determine the location of body parts and the doors they open up.  
<br>

<br>
You'll also need to place a single red-pixel (255 R, 0 B, 0G) on your map, this marks where the player spawns (the player spawns down and left of wherever you place this pixel)  
<br>
In the config file, you need to mark the location of a body part with: <br>
- H = Head
- A = Arm
- C = Chest
- L = Legs  <br>   

After each body part you should list the doors which you wish to be triggered (made to dissapear) after collection of the body part.

<br>
Coordinates are relative to the location of the command-block (marked by the red pixel) so coordinates up & left of this pixel are negative values and down & right are positive, with the command block itself being 0,0 always.
